> Building a webpage structure from a Figma design

## Project Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum to deepen HTML semantic skills by replicating a professional design. The goal is to **create a complete HTML-only version** of a webpage based on a Figma design.

For this first part, **no CSS or styling is allowed** â€” the focus is on clean, semantic, and accessible HTML structure.
